# DOSjinx
DOSjinx is an RPG game engine for MS-DOS

It is a project I started in 4-12-2020 to challenge my C programming abilities and to try my hand at some inline assembly.
Its development runs parallel to the development of my fantasy universe, Varel. jinx was designed with making a retro game about one of the stories set in this universe in mind.

It runs in Mode 13, so 320x200x256.
I intend to eventually port jinx to other platforms, the NES for example, or even OpenGL so games created with it can be compiled for modern PCs as well.
For now, DOS will suffice. This is the very first time I tried to make a serious game engine, so this will largely be a learning experience with hopefully a satisfying result in the end.
