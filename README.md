# DOSjinx
DOSjinx is an RPG game engine for MS-DOS

It is a project I started in 4-12-2020 to challenge my C programming abilities and to try my hand at some inline assembly.  
Its development runs parallel to the development of my fantasy universe, Varel. jinx was designed with making a retro game about one of the stories set in this universe in mind.

It runs in Mode 13, so 320x200x256. It is compiled in Borland Turbo C 3.0 which is included in the ASSETS folder. The Lua code in the project is a plugin for Aseprite which converts tiles into data strings useable for jinx. All the Aseprite files are also included in the ASSETS folder.

I intend to eventually port jinx to other platforms, the NES for example, or even OpenGL so games created with it can be compiled for modern PCs as well.
For now, DOS will suffice. This is the very first time I tried to make a serious game engine, so this will largely be a learning experience with hopefully a satisfying result in the end.
